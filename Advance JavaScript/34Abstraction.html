    <p>Abstraction in computer programming is a way to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and implementation
        in complex software systems. It hides the technical complexity of systems behind simpler APIs.</p>
    <h2>Advantages of Data Abstraction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Helps the user to avoid writing low-level code.</li>
        <li>Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.</li>
        <li>Can change the internal implementation of a class independently without affecting the user.</li>
        <li>Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the
            user.</li>
    </ul>
