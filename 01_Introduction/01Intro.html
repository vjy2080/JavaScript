    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows us to implement complex features on web
            pages.</li>`
        <li> Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for us.</li>`
        <li> To look at displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
            jukeboxes, etc.</li>`
        <li> We can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</li>`
        <li> It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have
            covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</li>`
    </ul>

    <h3>Why use JavaScript in web development?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> JavaScript makes responsive design easier.</li>
        <li> JavaScript has become integral to the Internet experience as developers build increased interaction and
            complexity into their applications.</li>
        <li> Search engines, ecommerce, content management systems, responsive design, social media and phone apps would
            not be possible without it.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3> What are Data Types in JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Data types in JavaScript define the type of data that a variable can store.</li>
        <li>JavaScript includes primitive and non-primitive data types.</li>
        <li>The primitive data types in JavaScript include string, number, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol.</li>
        <li>The non-primitive data type includes the object.</li>
        <li>A variable of primitive data type can contain only a single value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>JavaScript has 7 Datatypes</h3>

    <ol>
        <h4>JavaScript Data Types- Primitive</h4>
        <li> String</li>
        <li> Number</li>
        <li> Boolean</li>
        <li> Undefined</li>
        <li> Null</li>
        <li> Symbol</li>
        <h4>JavaScript Data Types- Non- Primitive</h4>
        <li> Object</li>
        <ul>
            <li> An object </li>
            <li> An array </li>
            <li> A date </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    
    <!-- ============================================================================================================== -->
    <ul>
        <li> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a Client side Scritpting language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on
            the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have
            a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</li>
        <li> JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
        <li> The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</li>
        <li> JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers
            and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</li>
    </ul>





    <p> Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
        are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
